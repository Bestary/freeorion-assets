FreeOrion assets
================

This repository is used to track the source files of media assets that
are used within the [FreeOrion] project.

Usage
-----

This repository copies the structure of the [data directory] within the
FreeOrion repository. The media assets should be placed in the same
directory and have the same name as their in-game variant only differ
by file extension.

If a media asset is the source of multiple in-game variants use the
base name for sequences or the most detailed variant place.

Beside every media asset a .info file with the same name should be
placed. A template plain-text .info file called template.info can be
found in the root of this repository.
